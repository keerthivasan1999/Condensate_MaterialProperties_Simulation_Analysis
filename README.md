# E–K Sequence Condensate Dynamics: Simulation and Analysis Repository

This repository contains all simulation inputs, example trajectories, and analysis scripts used in the study  
**_Sticky Interactions Govern Sequence-Dependent Dynamics in Biomolecular Condensates_**, which investigates the **monomer-level, chain-level, and macroscopic dynamics** of biomolecular condensates formed by glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K) sequences.

This repository compiles some simulation setups and analysis codes originally written by **Dinesh S. Devarajan** and collaborators. These codes were previously used in the study:

> **Sundaravadivelu Devarajan, D., Wang, J., Szała-Mendyk, B., Rekhi, S., Nikoubashman, A., Kim, Y.C., and Mittal, J.**  
> _Sequence-dependent material properties of biomolecular condensates and their relation to dilute phase conformations_,  
> **Nature Communications** (2024).  
> [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46223-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46223-w)

The current version is provided to support the analyses presented in our following manuscript on E–K sequence condensate dynamics:

> **Muthukumar, K., Sundaravadivelu Devarajan, D., Kim, Y.C., and Mittal, J.**  
> _Sticky Interactions Govern Sequence-Dependent Dynamics in Biomolecular Condensates_,  
> **Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences** (2026).
